= Shiva Web - Jade

To use, simply add this artefact as a dependency of your project. The web-fragment composition will take care of the
rest. If you want to provide context information to any of your templates, create an implementation of
`JadeModelProvider` where the result of `getTemplateName()` will be the name of the template to add context to, and add
it to the JadeFilter by way of OSGi service injection, or manual addition (`addProvider`).
